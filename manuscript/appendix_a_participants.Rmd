# Appendix A - Participants and Exclusions

```{r total participants}

# In order to trace children's development continuously across the preschool years. In order to align with conventions in the field, the study aimed to test at least two children per month of age between the third and seventh birthday for a minimum of 96 participants. As occasionally children participated on the basis of availability, the final sample comprises `r sum(rep.age.table.data$N)` children (`r sum(rep.age.table.data$female)` female) between `r min(rep.age.table.data$Min)` and `r min(rep.age.table.data$Max)` months of age.
