## Study 1

Smaller random-effect SDs, with wide CIs near zero → item-level variation is weaker and could even be negligible.

Correlation between intercept and age slope is highly uncertain.

Suggests that items as a grouping factor may not explain much additional variation.

sd(Intercept) = 0.16 [0.01, 0.40] --> Items differ slightly in baseline difficulty,  
0.16 log-odds corresponds to ~4 percentage points of accuracy --> effect of item is small

sd(z.age) = 0.14 [0.01, 0.34] --> modest variation across items in how strongly it interacts with age. 
effect size is small: ±0.14 log-odds ≈ ±3–4 percentage points per 1 SD in age.

cor(Intercept, z.age) = 0.35 [-0.84, 0.98] → uncertain. there is no clear age effect for slightly easier or slightly more difficult items

SUMMARY: Item-level effects are relatively small. Items are fairly homogeneous.

Model comp full model and item model

The two models have virtually identical predictive performance.

The difference in WAIC (≈ 1.6) is tiny compared to its uncertainty (SE ≈ 39).

The elpd_diff is well within one standard error of zero, meaning there’s no credible evidence that adding item-level random effects improves or harms predictive accuracy.

Notice that S1.item.model has a higher p_waic (88.5 vs. 80.5) → it’s a more complex model (greater effective number of parameters), but that complexity does not translate into better predictive fit.
